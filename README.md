sublimelinter-gutterthemes
==========================

A few simple gutter themes for SublimeLinter. I wanted the simplicity of a circle/dot, but found the default size too big/distracting so I created a smaller circle/dot (filled and outlined), and also a simple line (either horizontal and vertical).

Installation
------------
Copy the `Dot` and `Line` folders to your `.../Sublime Text 3/Packages/SublimeLinter/gutter-themes` folder and restart Sublime Text.
